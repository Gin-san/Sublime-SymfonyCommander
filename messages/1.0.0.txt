Integration of the Symfony 2 console right into Sublime Text 2

This Sublime Text 2 package integrates the most common Symfony 2 console commands right into your editor of choice (TM).

It provides the following features:

- Clear the cache
- Warmup an empty cache
- Assetic: Dump all assets to the filesystem
- Install bundles web assets under the public web directory
- Display current routes for an application
- Send emails from the spool

More commands are on the way.

If you need some Symfony code snippets in addition to this package just install [sublime-symfony2](https://github.com/raulfraile/sublime-symfony2). It is a great package for speed up your Symfony 2 develoment as well.

## Usage

### Command pallette

Open the Command Palette with the shortcut `Command+Shift+P` on OS X or `Control+Shift+P` otherwise.
Alternativ you can open the Command Pallete in the menu (_Tools -> Command Palette..._).

**Speedup tip:**

You don't need to type the complete command (`SymfonyCommander...`) in the Command Palette to get to to the right command.
For example if you type something short like `sccl` you get directly to the _SymfonyCommander cache:clear_ commands.

### Call the Symfony commands through the contextmenu of an file.


## Configuration

### Global settings

Settings can be configured with a `SymfonyCommander.sublime-settings` file in your `User` folder.
You can copy the one provided in this package.

	{
		"php_command": "/usr/bin/php"
	}

With `php_command` you can define where SymfonyCommander can find the php binary. If it is `false` than SymfonyCommader calls the Symfony console directly without php binary (works well on OS X an Linux).
Otherwise you can point `php_command` to the php binary path, for example `C:\php\php.exe` or `/usr/bin/php`.
The default is `false`.


### Project specific settings

SymfonyCommander tries to find the Symfony `app/console` script automatically. Therefor SymfonyCommander takes the active file an traverses the directory path up and searches for `app/console`.
This works in most cases.

Otherwise you have to tell SymfonyCommander where to find the console script on a project basis.
To point SymfonyCommander to the root directory of your symfony installation you need to set this path in the Sublime Text Project file (_*.sublime-project_) under the _settings_-section.

	"settings":{
		"SymfonyCommander":{
			"base_directory": "/www/htodcs/your-symfony-project/"
		}
	}
